# Never-Forget-The-Weather
Challenge 6
This is a weather app that will give you a 5 day forecast for any city in america. I built this app to allow people easy access to an accurate and reliable 5 day forecast. The forecast will include predictions for rain, wind speed,temperature and humiidty. To use it simply type the name of the city in. The app will also remember the cities you have typed in. Building this project taught me a great deal about serve side api's.
